This tutorial for Java developers covers the most basic functionality of the [N5 API](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5). We will learn about:

* creating readers and writers
* modifying and inspecting the hierarchy ("folder structure")
* saving and loading array data
* saving and loading metadata

## Readers and writers

[`N5Reader`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/blob/8e14d529276b57e1817ff21df9cac9fb1a517d59/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/N5Reader.java)s and 
[`N5Writer`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/blob/8e14d529276b57e1817ff21df9cac9fb1a517d59/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/N5Writer.java)s form 
the basis of the N5 API and allow you to read and write data, respectively. We generally recommend using an
[`N5Factory`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5-universe/blob/176ff469bb711eea3320535756b2e2594cb4eb61/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/universe/N5Factory.java) to create readers and writers:

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#make-reader-writer echo=true >}}

The N5 API gives you access to a number of different storage formats: HDF5, Zarr, and N5's own
format. `N5Factory`'s convenience methods try to infer the storage format from the extension
of the path you give it:

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#factory-types echo=true >}}

In fact, it is possible to read with `N5Writer`s since every `N5Writer`
is also an `N5Reader`, so from now on, we'll just be using the
`n5Writer.`

::: {.callout-tip}
## Try it!

We use the the N5 storage format for the rest of the tutorial, but it will work just as well using either
an HDF5 or Zarr writer.
:::

## Groups

N5 containers form hierarchies of *groups* - think "nested folders on your file system."
It's easy to create groups and test if they exist:

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#make-groups echo=true >}}

The `list` method lists groups that are children of the given group:

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#list echo=true >}}

and `deepList` recursively lists every descendent of the given group:

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#deep-list echo=true >}}

Notice that these methods *only* give information about what groups are present and do not provide information about metadata or array data.

::: {.callout-note}
Some storage / access systems (AWS-S3) separate permissions for reading and listing, meaning
it may be possible to access data but not list.
:::

## Arrays

N5 stores arrays in particular groups in the hierarchy. We call groups that contain arrays
"datasets" - [terminology inherited from HDF5](https://docs.hdfgroup.org/hdf5/develop/_g_l_s.html#title3).

::: {.callout-warning}
Datasets must be terminal (leaf) nodes in the container hierarchy - i.e. a dataset can not contain
another group or dataset. 
:::

We recommend using code from [n5-ij](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5-ij) or [n5-imglib2](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5-imglib2)
to write arrays. The examples in this post will use the latter.

The [`N5Utils`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5-imglib2/blob/241dc2b503d01007ec6aec72dacecc9706f023ab/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/imglib2/N5Utils.java)
class in n5-imglib2 has many useful methods, but in this post, we'll cover simple methods for reading and writing. First, 
[`N5Utils.save`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5-imglib2/blob/241dc2b503d01007ec6aec72dacecc9706f023ab/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/imglib2/N5Utils.java#L1440) 
writes an array and required array metadata to the container at a group that you specify. The group will be created if it does
not already exist. The parameters will be discussed in more detail below. 

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#n5-imglib2-save echo=true >}}

You can write blocks in parallel by providing an [`ExecutorService`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html) to this variant of
[`N5Utils.save`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5-imglib2/blob/241dc2b503d01007ec6aec72dacecc9706f023ab/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/imglib2/N5Utils.java#L1514)

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#n5-imglib2-save-exec echo=true >}}

Reading the array data from the container is also easy with
[`N5Utils.open`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5-imglib2/blob/241dc2b503d01007ec6aec72dacecc9706f023ab/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/imglib2/N5Utils.java#L428) :

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#n5-imglib2-open echo=true >}}

::: {.callout-warning}

## Overwriting data is possible

This save method *DOES NOT* perform any checks prior to writing data and will overwrite data that exists in the specified location.
Be sure to check and take appropriate action if it is possible that data could already at a particular location and 
container to avoid data loss or corruption.
:::

This example shows that data can be over written:

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#n5-imglib2-overwrite echo=true >}}

### Parameter details

#### `groupPath` 

is the group inside the container that will store the array. You can store an array at the
root of a container by specifying `""` or `"/"` as the `groupPath`. In this case, the container
will only be able to store one array (see the warning above at the start of the "Arrays" section).

#### `blockSize` 

is a very important parameter of an array. HDF5, N5, and Zarr all break up the arrays they store
into equally sized blocks or "chunks". The block size parameter specifies the size of these blocks.

For the example above, we stored an image of size `64 x 64` using blocks sized `32 x 32`. As a result, N5 uses
four blocks to store the entire image:

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#four-blocks echo=true >}}

*Quiz:* How many blocks would there be if the block size was `64 x 8`? 

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the answer.</summary>

There would be eight blocks.

One block covers the first dimension, but it takes 8 blocks to cover the second dimension ($8 \times 8 = 64$).
Also demonstrated by the code below:

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#eight-blocks echo=true >}}

</details>

::: {.callout-tip}
## Try it!

N5 lets you store your image in a single file if you want - just provide a block size that 
is equal to or larger than the image size.
:::

#### `compression` 

Each block is compressed independently, using the specified compressor.
Use [`RawCompression`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/blob/6d6a353060a1edb05c8da7ded96ec93c4b14a1c4/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/RawCompression.java)
to store blocks without compression.

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#no-compression echo=true >}}

Notice that blocks were previously ~1700-2000 bytes and are now ~4100 without compression.

The available compressors at the time of this writing are:

* [`BloscCompression`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5-blosc/blob/b4abb12cff739281fb703fd54975d6df654b021d/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/blosc/BloscCompression.java)
* [`Bzip2Compression`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/blob/6d6a353060a1edb05c8da7ded96ec93c4b14a1c4/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/Bzip2Compression.java)
* [`GzipCompression`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/blob/6d6a353060a1edb05c8da7ded96ec93c4b14a1c4/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/GzipCompression.java)
* [`Lz4Compression`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/blob/6d6a353060a1edb05c8da7ded96ec93c4b14a1c4/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/Lz4Compression.java)
* [`RawCompression`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/blob/6d6a353060a1edb05c8da7ded96ec93c4b14a1c4/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/RawCompression.java)
* [`XzCompression`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/blob/6d6a353060a1edb05c8da7ded96ec93c4b14a1c4/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/XzCompression.java)
* [`ZstandardCompression`](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/n5-zstandard/blob/1af7a5b56a60c0bb346f5795d936453557e1a947/src/main/java/org/janelia/scicomp/n5/zstandard/ZstandardCompression.java)

## Metadata

Besides array data, N5 can also store rich structured metadata. This tutorial will discuss basic, low-level metadata operations.
Advanced operations and metadata standards may be described in a future tutorial.

### Basics

`N5Writer`s have a
[`setAttribute`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/blob/6d6a353060a1edb05c8da7ded96ec93c4b14a1c4/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/N5Writer.java#L55) 
method for writing metadata to the storage backend. It takes three arguments:

```java
<T> void setAttribute(String groupPath, String attributePath, T attribute)
```

* `groupPath` : the group in which to store this metadata
* `attributePath` : the name of this attribute
* `attribute` : the metadata attribute to be stored. Can be an arbitrary type (denoted `T`).

::: {.callout-note}
There are differences between an attribute "name" and an attribute "path", but attribute "paths" are an advanced topic
and will be covered elsewhere.
:::

Similarly, `N5Reader`s have a 
[`getAttribute`](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5/blob/6d6a353060a1edb05c8da7ded96ec93c4b14a1c4/src/main/java/org/janelia/saalfeldlab/n5/N5Reader.java#L241-L244)
method:

```java
<T> T getAttribute(String groupPath, String attributePath, Class<T> clazz)
```

The last  argument (`Class<T>`) lets you specify the type that `getAttribute` should return.
An `N5Exception` will be thrown if the requested type can not be created from the requested attribute.
If an attribute does not exist, `null` will be returned (see the last example of this section).
Consider these examples:

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#attributes-1 echo=true >}}

Sometimes it is possible to interpret a metadata as multiple different types:

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#attr-types echo=true >}}

### Rich metadata

It possible to save attributes of arbitrary types, enabling you to struture your 
metadata into classes that are easy to save and load directly. For example, if we define a metadata class `FunWithMetadata`:

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#fun-with-metadata echo=true >}}

then make an instance and save it:

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#rich-metadata echo=true >}}

To retrieve all the metadata in a group as JSON:

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#all-metadata echo=true >}}

### Removing metadata

You can remove attributes by their name as well. To return the element that was removed, just provide the class for that element
(this mirrors the [remove method](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/List.html#remove-int-) for `List`s in Java.

{{< embed N5-Basics-Tutorial.ipynb#remove-attrs echo=true >}}

::: {.callout-tip}
## Try it!

The attributes that describe arrays are also accessible using `getAttribute`, try running: 
```java
n5Writer.getAttribute("data", "dimensions", long[].class);
```
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Warning

The attributes that N5 uses to read arrays can be set with `setAttribute`, and modifying them could corrupt your data.
**Do not manually set these attributes unless you absolutely know what you're doing!**

* `dimensions`
* `blockSize`
* `dataType`
* `compression`
